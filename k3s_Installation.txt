Step 1: Update and Install Dependencies

First, ensure your system is up to date and install some necessary dependencies:

bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl

Step 2: Download and Install k3s

You can install k3s using the provided installation script. This script will handle downloading and setting up k3s on your system.

bash

curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

This command downloads the installation script using curl and pipes it to sh to execute it. It will automatically install k3s and start the service.
Step 3: Verify Installation

Once the installation is complete, you can verify that k3s is running by checking the service status:

bash

sudo systemctl status k3s

This command should show the status of the k3s service and confirm whether it is active and running.
Step 4: Access k3s Cluster

By default, k3s will be configured to run as a single-node cluster. You can interact with the cluster using kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool.

To check the nodes in the cluster:

bash

kubectl get nodes

Optional: Managing k3s Service

You can manage the k3s service using systemctl commands. For example:

    To stop the service: sudo systemctl stop k3s
    To start the service: sudo systemctl start k3s
    To restart the service: sudo systemctl restart k3s

Step 5: Uninstall k3s (Optional)

If you want to uninstall k3s from your system, you can run the following command:

bash

sudo /usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh

This script will remove k3s along with its configuration files from your system.
Notes

    By default, k3s uses sqlite3 as the database backend for storing cluster information.
    The kubectl configuration file (kubeconfig.yaml) is located at /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml.
    Make sure to secure your cluster and configure additional settings as per your requirements.

After completing these steps, you should have a working installation of k3s on your Ubuntu machine.

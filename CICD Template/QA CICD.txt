CD Pipeline Overview for QA

    Artifact Management
        Harbor: Container registry for storing Docker images.
        Artifactory: Repository for storing additional build artifacts and dependencies.

    Deployment
        K3S: Lightweight Kubernetes distribution used in the QA environment.
        ArgoCD: GitOps tool for managing deployments to Kubernetes.

    Automated Testing
        Selenium: For automated UI testing.
        Acunetix: For automated web vulnerability scanning.
        JMeter: For performance and load testing.

    Notifications
        Notify Mail: To inform stakeholders about the deployment and testing results.

Detailed CD Pipeline Workflow for QA

    Trigger Deployment
        Triggering Event: The CD pipeline is triggered after successful CI processes or a manual trigger when the code is ready for QA.
        Artifact Retrieval: Fetch the latest Docker image from Harbor or build artifacts from Artifactory.

    Deploy to QA Environment

        ArgoCD Configuration:
            Ensure ArgoCD is configured to point to the appropriate Git repository containing Kubernetes manifests for the QA environment.
            Update the ArgoCD application configuration if necessary (e.g., image tags, environment variables).

        Deployment Execution:
            ArgoCD applies the Kubernetes manifests to deploy the Docker image to the K3S cluster in the QA environment.
            ArgoCD continuously monitors the deployed application to ensure it matches the desired state specified in the Git repository.

    Automated Testing

        Functional Testing:
            Selenium tests are executed against the deployed application to validate that the UI works correctly and that there are no regressions or new issues.
            Selenium tests include various scenarios, such as user interactions, form submissions, and navigation flows.

        Security Testing:
            Acunetix performs a web vulnerability scan on the application to detect potential security issues, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities.

        Performance Testing:
            JMeter runs performance and load tests to assess how the application handles different levels of user load and stress.
            Metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates are collected and analyzed.

    Post-Deployment Verification
        Validation Checks:
            Perform post-deployment validation to ensure that the application is running as expected.
            Manual or automated checks may include verifying application availability, basic functionality, and overall stability.

    Notifications
        Notify Mail:
            Send notifications via email to relevant stakeholders (e.g., development team, QA team) with details on:
                Deployment status (success/failure).
                Results of automated tests (functional, security, performance).
                Any issues or errors encountered during deployment or testing.

    Feedback and Rollback

        Issue Reporting:
            Any issues discovered during automated or manual testing are reported to the development team for resolution.
            Use issue tracking tools or direct communication for effective feedback.

        Rollback Strategy:
            If critical issues are identified, initiate a rollback of the deployment using ArgoCDâ€™s rollback feature or manual intervention.
            Deploy the previous stable version from Harbor to restore the QA environment to a known good state.

    Artifact Management
        Archiving:
            Archive relevant artifacts (Docker images, build artifacts) in Artifactory for future reference or auditing.
            Clean up outdated or unused images from Harbor to manage storage and maintain efficiency.

Additional Considerations

    Environment Configuration: Ensure that environment-specific configurations (e.g., database endpoints, API keys) are properly managed and kept separate from code.

    Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring and logging for the QA environment to capture metrics, logs, and other data for troubleshooting and analysis.

    Documentation: Maintain clear documentation for the deployment process, configurations, and any specific considerations for the QA environment.

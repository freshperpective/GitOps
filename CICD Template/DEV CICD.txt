CI/CD Pipeline Overview

    Source Code Management
        Bitbucket: This is where your source code is stored and versioned. Developers commit their changes to the Bitbucket repository.

    Build and Code Quality
        SonarQube: Integrated into the CI pipeline to perform static code analysis. It checks for code quality issues, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
        Unittesting: Automated unit tests run to validate the functionality of code changes. This ensures that new code does not break existing functionality.

    Artifact Management
        Harbor: A container registry where Docker images are stored. It is used to manage and distribute container images.
        Artifactory: An artifact repository for storing build artifacts, such as libraries, binaries, and other dependencies.

    Containerization
        Docker: Used to build container images from your application code. Docker ensures that your application runs consistently across different environments.

    Security
        Image Scanning: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities. This step ensures that images do not contain known security issues before they are deployed.
        Image Signing: Signs Docker images to ensure their integrity and authenticity. This helps to verify that the images have not been tampered with.
        Image Tagging: Tags Docker images with version numbers or other identifiers to manage different versions of the images effectively.

    Deployment
        ArgoCD: Handles the deployment of your application. ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It ensures that the desired state of your application is maintained in the Kubernetes cluster.

    Notifications
        Notify Mail: Sends notifications via email to inform the development team about the status of builds, tests, deployments, and other CI/CD events.

Detailed CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

    Code Commit
        Developers push code changes to the Bitbucket repository.

    CI Pipeline Trigger
        A push to Bitbucket triggers the CI pipeline.

    Code Quality Analysis
        SonarQube performs static code analysis to check for code quality issues.

    Unit Testing
        Automated unit tests are executed to ensure code changes do not introduce regressions.

    Build Docker Image
        Docker builds a new container image from the source code and related files.

    Image Scanning
        The newly built Docker image is scanned for vulnerabilities using Image Scanning tools.

    Image Signing
        The Docker image is signed to ensure its authenticity.

    Image Tagging
        The Docker image is tagged with a version number or identifier.

    Push to Harbor
        The tagged Docker image is pushed to Harbor for storage and distribution.

    Artifact Management
        Build artifacts are stored in Artifactory.

    Deployment Preparation
        ArgoCD is configured to deploy the Docker image from Harbor to the development environment.

    Deployment Execution
        ArgoCD deploys the application to the development Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that the desired state is reflected.

    Notification
        Notify Mail sends an email with details about the build, test results, and deployment status.

Additional Considerations

    Branching Strategy: Implement a branching strategy in Bitbucket (e.g., feature branches, develop branch, main branch) to manage different stages of development and integration.

    Automated Rollbacks: Configure ArgoCD or other tools to automatically rollback deployments in case of failures.

    Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring and logging to track the health and performance of your application in the development environment.

    Configuration Management: Manage configuration changes separately from code changes, possibly using tools like ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes.

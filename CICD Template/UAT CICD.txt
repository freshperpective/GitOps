Detailed CD Pipeline Workflow for UAT

    Trigger Deployment
        Triggering Event: Deployment is triggered either automatically (e.g., after successful CI) or manually when code is ready for UAT testing.
        Artifact Retrieval: Fetch the latest Docker image from Harbor or build artifacts from Artifactory.

    Prepare Deployment

        Helm Charts Preparation:
            Update Helm charts to reflect UAT-specific configurations such as environment variables, feature toggles, and resource limits.

        ArgoCD Configuration:
            Ensure ArgoCD is configured with the correct Git repository containing Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests for UAT.

    Deploy to UAT Environment

        ArgoCD Deployment:
            ArgoCD manages the deployment using Helm charts. It synchronizes the state of the UAT environment with the desired state defined in the Git repository.

        Helm Deployment:
            Helm applies the Helm charts to deploy Docker images to the K3S cluster. This includes creating or updating Kubernetes resources like Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.

    Service Mesh Configuration
        Istio and Envoy Setup:
            Ensure Istio is correctly configured and deployed in the UAT environment.
            Deploy and configure Envoy proxies for managing service-to-service communication.
            Set up Istio configurations such as VirtualServices and DestinationRules to manage traffic routing and policies.

    Security and Policy Enforcement
        Kyverno Policies:
            Apply Kyverno policies to enforce security, compliance, and best practices within the UAT environment. This may include policies for resource limits, security context constraints, and network policies.

    Observability Setup

        Prometheus:
            Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from applications and Kubernetes components. Set up Prometheus to monitor key metrics such as CPU/memory usage, request rates, and error rates.

        Grafana:
            Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus. Create or update dashboards to monitor application performance, resource utilization, and other relevant metrics.

        Kiali:
            Integrate Kiali with Istio to visualize the service mesh topology. Use Kiali to monitor service interactions, traffic flows, and service health.

    Post-Deployment Verification
        Initial Verification:
            Conduct basic checks to ensure that the application is running as expected. Verify that services are up, configurations are correct, and traffic is being routed appropriately through Istio.

    User Acceptance Testing

        Testing by UAT Team:
            The UAT team performs manual testing to ensure the application meets user requirements. This includes functional testing, user interface testing, and integration testing.

        Automated Testing (if applicable):
            Run automated tests if they are part of the UAT process to validate end-to-end functionality and regression.

    Monitoring and Alerts

        Prometheus Alerts:
            Set up Prometheus Alerts to notify of critical issues, such as high error rates, latency issues, or resource exhaustion. Configure alerting rules based on metrics collected by Prometheus.

        Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:
            Continuously monitor the UAT environment using Grafana dashboards and Prometheus metrics. Investigate any anomalies or performance issues.

    Notifications

    Notify Mail:
        Send notifications via email to relevant stakeholders about:
            Deployment status (success/failure).
            Results from UAT testing.
            Any issues detected by monitoring or alerts.

    Feedback and Issue Management

    Feedback Collection:
        Collect feedback from the UAT team regarding the applicationâ€™s functionality, usability, and any issues encountered.

    Issue Reporting:
        Document and report any issues or bugs back to the development team for resolution. Use issue tracking systems to manage these issues.

    Rollback (if necessary)

    Rollback Strategy:
        If significant issues are found, initiate a rollback using ArgoCD or Helm to revert to the previous stable version. Ensure rollback procedures are tested and documented.

    Artifact Management

    Archiving:
        Archive Docker images and Helm charts in Artifactory for historical reference. Clean up outdated or unused images in Harbor to maintain storage efficiency.

Additional Considerations

    Security: Regularly review and update security policies enforced by Kyverno. Ensure that sensitive data is protected and that access controls are in place.

    Documentation: Keep comprehensive documentation of the deployment process, configurations, and any specific considerations for the UAT environment.

    Backup and Recovery: Implement backup strategies for configurations and data in the UAT environment to ensure recovery in case of failures.

    Capacity Planning: Monitor resource utilization and plan for capacity needs to handle expected load during UAT.
